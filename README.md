# Infinite Coin Problem

Imagine an infinite number of fair coins. Each coin is flipped once. If it lands on heads, the coin is kept. If not, it is removed. Kept coins are flipped again and the process repeats until there is one or no coins. What is the probability there is one coin at the end?

## How to Use the Plot Function
1. Have Python installed to your system.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run this command:
```
source plotEnv/bin/activate
```
4. Run this command:
```
python3 Plots/plot.py
```
Note: Change up the plot file if you want different information.
As it is, the file only plots to 1000 data points, but we have around
40000 recorded in the Sequence.txt file.
